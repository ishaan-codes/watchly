# Watchly - Media Tracking Platform  

## Overview  
Watchly is a full-stack web application designed for managing media content consumption. It provides users with tools to track watched videos, follow content creators, and organize viewing history. The system implements secure authentication, profile management, and media metadata handling through a RESTful API architecture.  

## Key Features  

### Core Functionality  
- **User Authentication**:  
  - JWT-based authentication with access/refresh token rotation  
  - Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing  
  - Cookie-based token management with HTTP-only flags  

- **Media Management**:  
  - Video metadata tracking (duration, views, publication status)  
  - Watch history aggregation with nested user data  
  - Thumbnail support for visual content representation  

- **Profile System**:  
  - Avatar and cover image management via Cloudinary integration  
  - Channel subscription tracking with bi-directional relationships  
  - User analytics (subscriber counts, channel engagement)  

### Advanced Capabilities  
- **Content Discovery**:  
  - Channel profile system with subscription metrics  
  - Watch history tracking with video metadata enrichment  

- **Security Infrastructure**:  
  - Middleware-based route protection  
  - Token refresh mechanism with cryptographic verification  
  - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration  

## Technical Architecture  

### System Components  
1. **Data Layer**:  
   - MongoDB document storage with Mongoose ODM  
   - Relational modeling for user subscriptions  
   - Aggregation pipelines for complex queries  

2. **Service Layer**:  
   - Express.js REST API endpoints  
   - Controller-based business logic separation  
   - Custom error handling framework  

3. **Security Layer**:  
   - JWT token validation middleware  
   - File upload validation through Multer  
   - Input sanitization for user-generated content  

### Design Principles  
- **Modular Structure**:  
  - Clear separation between routes, controllers, and models  
  - Reusable middleware components  
  - Centralized error handling mechanisms  

- **Performance Considerations**:  
  - Database indexing for frequent queries  
  - Projection optimization for network efficiency  
  - Batch operations for related data updates  

## Security Implementation  
- **Authentication Flow**:  
  1. Credential validation with salted password hashes  
  2. Dual-token system for session management  
  3. Automatic token revocation on logout  

- **Data Protection**:  
  - Selective field exclusion in database queries  
  - Secure cookie configuration attributes  
  - Environment-based secret management  

## Error Handling Strategy  
- Custom error classes for API responses  
- Standardized HTTP status code usage  
- Error cascading prevention through middleware  
- Validation checks for critical operations:  
  - File upload integrity verification  
  - Token payload validation  
  - User input sanitization  

## Scalability Aspects  
- Stateless authentication design  
- Database-agnostic service layer  
- Pagination-ready aggregation queries  
- Horizontal scaling capabilities through:  
  - Decoupled service components  
  - Environment-aware configuration  
  - Cloud-based file storage integration  

This architecture provides a foundation for extending features while maintaining stability and security. The system prioritizes maintainability through clear separation of concerns and adherence to RESTful principles.
